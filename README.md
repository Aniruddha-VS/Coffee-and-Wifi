# Coffee-and-Wifi Project


This is a CRUD application created using Flask Application.

Here basic idea is that within a city people face difficulties to find a good cafe where they can work and spend their time productively using the cafe database.
Once deployed, user can add cafes with important information such as Address, Charging Sockets, Sanitation, Coffee price etc. This information will be visible
to all like opensource information. False information can be deleted from the databse using a key which will be with the admin of the platform administrator.


Special thanks to Dr. Angela Yu for creating the course 100 days of python course which enabled me to created this application.
